# Emoji-Pass-X
An Emoji based Password Manager for iOS, iPadOS and macOS.
Every record has its own encrpytion key.
That key is encrypted with a private key based on a unqiue algorithm.
Data is encrypted end-ot-end by Apple using the user's iCloud account.
The user's data is protected with Biometrics or the user's iCloud password.
I decided to make this software open source for transparency. No personal info or data is collected by this App.

Disclaimer: If you do not purchase from the AppStore, iCloudKit data protection may not work. In addition, if you manually turn off iCloud or remove Emoji-Pass-X data from your iCloud, the data most likely will not be backed up to your iCloud account. We take no responsibility for data loss. No information is stored away from your devices or iCloud. There is not secondary backup. When used properly, Emoji-Pass-X encrpyted data resides on the device and is synced with the user's iCloud account. If this data is somehow removed from the user's iCloud, there is no way to recover this sensitive data.

We may one day include an in-app subscribtion to keep secondary backup and history, but this future feature will be for premium users only and will not be open sourced.
