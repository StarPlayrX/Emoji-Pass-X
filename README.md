# Emoji-Pass-X
The best Top Secret Password Manager for iOS and macOS
Every record has its own encrpytion key
That key is encrypted with a private key based on a unqiue algorithm
Data is encrypted end-ot-end by Apple using the user's iCloud account
The user's data is protected with Biometrics or the user's iCloud password.
We may beef this up with local authentication if the user has biometrics, it will require it.
We may also add Security Keys starting with macOS 12 and later.
I decided to make this software open source for transparency.
